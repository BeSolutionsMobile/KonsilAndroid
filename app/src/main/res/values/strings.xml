    <string name="terms">AGB Konsilmed UG

General terms and conditions of Konsilmed UG (limited liability), Mainzer Landstra? E 50, 60328 Frankfurt am Main. ("Konsilmed"), for the use of the online consultation under and other under the portal advisory services

Konsilmed does not provide any medical advice and is itself not approved as a doctor or in any other medical profession. Konsilmed operates exclusively the technical service of the platform. The advisory service is provided by the participating doctors.

Part 1: Service users
            1. Contents of the services
(1) Konsilmed provides a technical platform that patients can use to get in touch with doctors. Patients can agree and conduct online counseling with the doctors. The video consultation takes place directly between the patient via an encrypted connection. Konsilmed only provides the technical processing of the service.
                (2) Konsilmed is not responsible for the content of communication between doctor and patient. Konsilmed does not offer any medical or therapeutic services. Neither the use of Konsilmed nor the agreement of online counseling with doctors replace a traditional visit to the doctor. See a doctor or psychotherapist on site or in an emergency, if necessary.
        (3) The use of Konsilmed is free of charge for the patients. Separate fees may be charged for the services provided by doctors. These are clearly identified to the patient. These services are billed directly to the patient via Konsilmed, even if the medical advice is provided directly by the doctors. In this respect, Konsilmed only acts as a clearing house.
(4) As soon as the patient contacts a doctor, there is a separate contract with the doctors condition. This can result in costs for the patient. The doctor will inform the patient of this separately.
